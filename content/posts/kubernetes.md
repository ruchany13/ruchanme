*Hello Everyone! In this post, I'll talk about an architecture. This post maybe a little bit long because I'll create from scratch but simple and easy. I'll build an architecture with Terraform, Ansible,and Kubernetes. We'll use Promotheus,Kibana, ElasticSearch, and Nginx in Kubernetes. Don't worry about this! It'll be very funny.*
