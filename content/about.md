# Ruchan Yalçın
Hello!
I'm CS student at Yalova University and DevOps Engineer at Basistek Information Tech. In my job, I set up, configure, and maintain on-premise K8S environments for customers.

In this website, I'm writing useful information about DevOps. 

You can ask anything ruchany13@gmail.com .

I'm always open for a new job :)
