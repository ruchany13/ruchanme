# Ruchan Yalçın
 I'm currently student at computer engineering. In my first year, I interested in cyber security for learning how 
can I keep safe myself and my job. After that I started study about operation systems especially Linux. I 
studied about some problems and scripts. I learned Linux commands, bash script and Linux architecture. After 
that, I learned container technology especially Docker and Kubernetes. I learned nginx, flask, database 
systems, and cloud systems (AWS, Digital Ocean) for use in container and my website. Now, I’m learning
DevOps tools (ansible and Jenkins).
Meanwhile, I'm currently working at Yalova University Network Lab as a researcher. I'm study
about operation systems, network protocols and Linux configuration. Also, we are doing cloud computing 
projects.

**My first project** is Distributed Smart City Application Design and Implementation with Kubernetes Cluster on 
Edge Devices. I was team leader at the project. The This research project aims to combine Cloud Computing 
and Edge Computing to build an intelligent air-quality monitoring system in the Yalova University campus. A 
set of Raspberry Pi 4 devices will be equipped with digital temperature and humidity sensors. Edge devices 
will used to Docker container technology for applications. K3S and KubeEdge will be tested and evaluated on 
edge devices. The collected sensory data will be sent periodically in a predefined interval to a server box. The 
Jetson Nano developer kits will process temperature and humidity data on the server. A web-based interface 
and a monitoring system will be implemented to provide air-quality information to the users. Ganglia Monitor 
tool will be used for monitoring energy consumption, network speed, and energy use of application. 
Monitoring performance data will be stored in the server. The hybrid edge computing and cloud computing 
performance will be evaluated against a pure cloud computing air-quality monitoring system. I experienced 
Kubernetes, Raspberyy Pi, Docker, Database Systems, Nginx and Azure Cloud system.

**My second project** is http://ruchan.me website (this site). I'm running an Ubuntu Server on Digital Ocean's droplet. I'm 
running my websites with container technologies especially Docker, Kubernetes. I'm trying CI/CD tools on my 
website. Every page has an information about their technologies and files in my Github and Gitlab.
I want to be long term internship. I can 6-9 months internship on your companies. I don’t have any problems 
for visa and passport.

I wish to participate in projects in order to obtain more expertise in DevOps and continue my career in this 
domain. I also feel competent in contributing to the team and the company that I work with in terms of 
maintaining communication and inter-team interaction within the company.
