# Distributed Smart City Application Design and Implementation with Kubernetes Cluster on Edge Devices

This research project aims to combine Cloud Computing and Edge Computing to build an intelligent air-quality monitoring system in the Yalova University campus. A set of Raspberry Pi 4 devices will be equipped with digital temperature and humidity sensors. Edge devices will used to Docker container technology for applications. K3S and KubeEdge will be tested and evaluated on edge devices. The collected sensory data will be sent periodically in a predefined interval to a server box. The Jetson Nano developer kits will process temperature and humidity data on the server. A web-based interface and a monitoring system will be implemented to provide air-quality information to the users. Ganglia Monitor tool will be used for monitoring energy consumption, network speed, and energy use of application. Monitoring performance data will be stored in the server. The hybrid edge computing and cloud computing performance will be evaluated against a pure cloud computing air-quality monitoring system.
Technologies : Kubernetes, Docker, Raspbian, MariaDB, Nginx, Ganglia Monitoring App
